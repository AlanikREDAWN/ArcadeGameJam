# Galactic Loophole
This is my submission for the game jam. It takes place on an abandoned space station.
The controls are fairly simple:
WASD for movement, Q to trigger chance for lighting to change, E to swap gravity, and Space bar to jump. Esc pauses the game.
You can customize these controls as needed.

You can download the game here:
