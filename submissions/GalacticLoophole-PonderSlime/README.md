# Galactic Loophole
This is my submission for the game jam. It takes place on an abandoned space station.
The controls are fairly simple:

## Basic controls
| Key | Action        |
|-----|---------------|
| W   | Walk forward  |
| S   | Walk backward |
| A   | Walk left     |
| D   | Walk right    |
| Q   | Toggle Light      |
| E   | Swap Gravity  |
| Esc | Pause         |

You can customize these in the pause menu.
